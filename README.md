  Hi ! 
  This is in abslute the first time that I post a project on the web.

  My passion for the electronics and later for the programming began when I was eleven years old.
 
  At that time , early 1970 , the terms “makers” or “nerd” probably were not jet invented or 
  at leat  used in Italy,and I was just a child that instead that play football was playing with
  some resistors, capacitors removed from some old radios. 

  Anyway , that passion started in the '70 , now that I'm fifty-two years old , still live and the 
  curiosity to learn new things never end and thanks to the new opportunities offered in the last 
  10-15 years by new technology and products as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and PyBoard
  it's growing.   
   
  This project is a simple weekly timer , nothing of so exiting or complex if compared with 
   some project done around those boards, but has helped me to learn new things in areas like 
   MicroPython ,Processing2 and PyBoard.

   I share it , hoping that could be usefull for others that like me wants start to play around these 
   things. 

   In this project I use upower.py module written by Peter Hinch
    https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-micropower.
    Ensure to have installed upower.py in the pyBoard together with the irrigatoreBT V07.py 

   Give a look to upower documentation to better understand how it works.

   Enjoy with MicroPython and pyBoard !


   Roberto.
